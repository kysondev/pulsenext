**Phizy-Stack** is a powerful command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to streamline the setup of modern full-stack applications built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**. Whether you're starting a new project or integrating essential features into an existing one, Phizy-Stack saves you time by generating boilerplate code, wiring up common tools, and following best practices out of the box.

Originally developed as a personal tool to accelerate full-stack app development, Phizy-Stack is now open to the community—ideal for indie hackers, solo builders, and teams who want to hit the ground running with a clean and scalable architecture.

## What Does It Do

Phizy-Stack helps you:

- **Create new full-stack Next.js projects** in seconds using a custom project template.
- **Add production-ready modules** with one command—authentication, database setup, payment systems, and more.
- **Stay focused on features**, not boilerplate.

No need to wire up Stripe, Resend, or Prisma manually. With Phizy-Stack, the basics are already configured—just plug in your API keys and go.

## What’s Included

Phizy-Stack is opinionated in all the right ways. Every generated project and module is pre-configured with the tools and technologies that power modern web applications:

- **Next.js** – For building high-performance full-stack React apps
- **TypeScript** – For static typing and a better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** – For rapid UI development with utility-first styling
- **Prisma + PostgreSQL** – For robust, type-safe database access
- **better-auth** – A clean, extendable authentication system
- **Resend** – For email APIs that just work
- **Stripe** – Payment integration (coming soon!)

Each piece is designed to integrate smoothly, following scalable architecture patterns and best practices.

## Why Use Phizy-Stack

If you’ve ever...

- Found yourself repeating the same setup steps every time you start a new project
- Wanted prewritten, high-quality modules for common features
- Preferred building real features over configuring tools and libraries

...then Phizy-Stack is built for you.

Spend less time wiring things up, and more time shipping real functionality.

## Who Is It For

Phizy-Stack is perfect for:

- **Solo developers** and **freelancers** starting new client projects
- **Startup founders** bootstrapping MVPs
- **Teams** who want a solid base and repeatable workflows
- Anyone who loves the Next.js + TypeScript stack and wants to move fast
