**PulseNext** is a powerful command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to streamline the setup of modern full-stack applications built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**. Whether you're starting a new project or integrating essential features into an existing one, PulseNext saves you time by generating boilerplate code, wiring up common tools, and following best practices out of the box.

Originally developed as a personal tool to accelerate full-stack app development, PulseNext is now open to the community—ideal for indie hackers, solo builders, and teams who want to hit the ground running with a clean and scalable architecture.

## What Does It Do

PulseNext helps you:

- **Create new full-stack Next.js projects** in seconds using a custom project template.
- **Add production-ready modules** with one command—authentication, database setup, payment systems, and more.
- **Stay focused on features**, not boilerplate.

No need to wire up Stripe, Resend, or Prisma manually. With PulseNext, the basics are already configured—just plug in your API keys and go.

## What’s Included

PulseNext is opinionated in all the right ways. Every generated project and module is pre-configured with the tools and technologies that power modern web applications:

- **Next.js** – For building high-performance full-stack React apps
- **TypeScript** – For static typing and a better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** – For rapid UI development with utility-first styling
- **Prisma + PostgreSQL** – For robust, type-safe database access
- **better-auth** – A clean, extendable authentication system
- **Resend** – For email APIs that just work
- **Stripe** – Payment integration (coming soon!)

Each piece is designed to integrate smoothly, following scalable architecture patterns and best practices.

## Why Use PulseNext

If you’ve ever...

- Found yourself repeating the same setup steps every time you start a new project
- Wanted prewritten, high-quality modules for common features
- Preferred building real features over configuring tools and libraries

...then PulseNext is built for you.

Spend less time wiring things up, and more time shipping real functionality.

## Who Is It For

PulseNext is perfect for:

- **Solo developers** and **freelancers** starting new client projects
- **Startup founders** bootstrapping MVPs
- **Teams** who want a solid base and repeatable workflows
- Anyone who loves the Next.js + TypeScript stack and wants to move fast
