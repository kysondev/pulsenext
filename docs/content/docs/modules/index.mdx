Modules in PulseNext are plug-and-play features you can add to any project with a single command. Each module is prebuilt, fully integrated, and follows best practices—so you can move fast without wiring things up manually.

## How It Works

To add a module to your project:

```bash
pulsenext add <module-name>
```

Example:

```bash
pulsenext add auth
```

Each module installs the required code, config, dependencies, and environment variables.

## Available Modules

### `auth`

Adds a complete authentication system using [better-auth](https://www.better-auth.com/), integrated with Prisma and Next.js.

---

### `database`

Sets up **PostgreSQL** with **Prisma**, including schema files, migration scripts, and type-safe database access.

→ [Read more](/docs/modules/database)

### `stripe` _(coming soon)_

Payment integration using **Stripe** with prebuilt backend and UI components.

→ Docs coming soon
