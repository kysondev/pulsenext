The **auth** module adds a full authentication system to your project using [better-auth](https://www.better-auth.com/). It includes everything you need to get started with sign in, sign out, and session management.

This module is fully integrated with Prisma and Next.js App Router.

## Installation

Add the auth module with the CLI:

```bash
phizy-stack add auth
```

Then regenerate your Prisma schema:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

This will:

- Set up **better-auth** with prebuilt configuration
- Add Prisma models for users and accounts
- Create auth routes under `/auth`
- Add reusable hooks and session context
- Configure environment variables

## What's Included

- **Authentication Routes**  
  Predefined routes for sign in, sign out, and callbacks

- **OAuth Support**  
  Supports OAuth providers (e.g. GitHub, Google) with a simple config

- **Prisma Integration**  
  Adds `User` and `Account` models with migrations ready to run

## Configuration

Update your `.env` file with the required environment variables:

```
APP_NAME=MyApp
AUTH_SECRET=your-secret
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-github-client-id
