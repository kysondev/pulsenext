Get up and running with Phizy-Stack in just a few commands.

## 1. Install the CLI

Make sure **Node.js** is installed on your system.

To install Phizy-Stack globally:

```bash
npm install -g phizy-stack
```

## 2. Create a New Project

Generate a new full-stack Next.js project using the CLI:

```bash
phizy-stack create my-app
```

This will scaffold a project with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, and more.

## 3. Add a Module

Navigate into your project folder and add your first module:

```bash
cd my-app
phizy-stack add auth
```

Modules are fully pre-configured and production-ready. Examples include:

- `auth` – Authentication with better-auth
- `database` – PostgreSQL + Prisma setup
- `payment` – Payments system with stripe (coming soon)

## 4. Start Building

After adding modules, open the project in your editor and start building:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Your app is now running locally on `http://localhost:3000`.
